# openalex-schema-mariadb

This SQL will create the OpenALex (openalex.org) schema in MariaDB

This is forked from the Postgres gist at: https://gist.github.com/richard-orr/4c30f52cf5481ac68dc0b282f46f1905 with modifications to work with MariaDB conventions (timestamps do not store time zone, keys require defined lengths for each subcomponent, syntax)
